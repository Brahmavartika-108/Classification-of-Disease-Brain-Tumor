# Classification-of-Disease-Brain-Tumor
# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection with VGG16 🔬

Welcome to one of the most impactful applications of Deep Learning in Healthcare! This project leverages **Transfer Learning** with the **VGG16** architecture to classify **brain MRI scans** into different tumor categories. Designed to be **accurate**, **scalable**, and **privacy-conscious**, this repository is a step toward smarter, AI-driven medical diagnostics.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- ✅ **Transfer Learning with VGG16** (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- 🧪 Classification of MRI images into: `Glioma`, `Meningioma`, `Pituitary`, or `No Tumor`
- 📊 Confusion Matrix, Accuracy-Loss Visualization, and Real Sample Display
- 📁 Custom Data Generator for Efficient Training
- 🔒 Modular and Extensible for real-world healthcare integration

## 📂 Dataset Structure

The model was trained and tested on a labeled MRI image dataset organized as:

/MRI Images ├── Training/ │ ├── glioma/ │ ├── meningioma/ │ ├── pituitary/ │ └── no/ └── Testing/ ├── glioma/ ├── meningioma/ ├── pituitary/ └── no/

> 💡 Each subfolder contains MRI scans of the corresponding tumor type.

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

We built on the VGG16 backbone and fine-tuned the last few layers:

- 🔹 Input Image: `128x128x3`
- 🔹 Base: `VGG16 (frozen with partial fine-tuning)`
- 🔹 Layers: `Flatten → Dropout → Dense → Dropout → Softmax`

Training parameters:

optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=1e-4)
loss = sparse_categorical_crossentropy
epochs = 5
batch_size = 20
